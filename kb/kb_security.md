### RULE: Data Masking Patterns
CONTEXT: Sensitive data must be masked in logs and debug output to prevent exposure
REQUIREMENT: Data masking must be applied consistently across all logging and debug scenarios
FAIL IF:
- Sensitive data visible in application logs
- Debug output contains unmasked financial information
- Error messages expose sensitive data details
- Data masking not applied consistently
- Masking patterns not comprehensive for all data types
VERIFICATION: Check data masking implementation in logs and debug output
REFERENCES: Logging implementations, masking patterns, debug configurations

## Biometric Authentication

### RULE: Biometric Prompt Implementation
CONTEXT: Biometric authentication provides secure and convenient access for field officers
REQUIREMENT: Biometric authentication must be properly implemented with fallback mechanisms
FAIL IF:
- Biometric prompt not properly configured
- Biometric authentication not integrated with app security
- Error handling not comprehensive for biometric failures
- Biometric data not properly protected
- Integration not following Android biometric guidelines
VERIFICATION: Check biometric prompt implementation and security integration

### RULE: Fallback Authentication
CONTEXT: Fallback authentication ensures access when biometric authentication is unavailable
REQUIREMENT: Fallback authentication must be secure and properly integrated with biometric flow
FAIL IF:
- Fallback authentication weaker than primary method
- Fallback flow not properly secured
- User experience not smooth during fallback
- Fallback authentication not properly validated
- Security level not maintained during fallback
VERIFICATION: Check fallback authentication implementation and security level
REFERENCES: Fallback authentication, security validation, user experience

### RULE: Biometric Data Security
CONTEXT: Biometric data must be protected according to privacy regulations and security standards
REQUIREMENT: Biometric data must be handled securely with proper privacy protection
FAIL IF:
- Biometric data stored insecurely
- Biometric templates not properly protected
- Privacy policies not covering biometric data usage
- Biometric data shared without proper consent
